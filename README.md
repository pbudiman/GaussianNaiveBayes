### By: Janice Theresia Sutrisno (1013239) & Patricia Angelica Budiman (1012861)

Objective: 
1. Implement a supervised Naive Bayes learner to classify pose from key- points provided by a deep convolutional neural network
2. The classifier is trained, tested, & evaluated on the provided dataset. 
3. Assuming location dataset is located in : 
  - COMP30027_2021_assignment1_data/test.csv
  - COMP30027_2021_assignment1_data/train.csv
  
A. To re-create Gaussian Naive Bayes result:
1. Run the ***PREPROCESSING*** block
2. Run the ***TRAIN*** block
3. Run the ***PREDICT*** block
4. Run the ***EVALUATE*** block
5. Run the ***RUN HERE*** block to run all the functions

B. To re-create results for Q 1,3,4,5:
1. Run each block under each questions
2. If error occurs, please run Section A.
